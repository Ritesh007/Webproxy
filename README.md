# Webproxy
The primary goal of this project is to illustrate the working of a web proxy server. To embark on this goal we use few more modules such as: Client, Server and Cache. Here we accomplish the project in such a way that the client sends the request and server responds to it through the proxy server and those files are saved in the cache. And our objective is that whenever we get identical response from the server for the same URL the request is not forwarded to the server as we get the response from the web proxy. The front end part is implemented by Java applet while the back end is implemented through java.
